basic starting file structure for Umass Dartmouth

This project was a fun one.

I really enjoyed creating this website and playing around with all the animations and effects I could make. It was a great experience and I'm happy with all the feedback I've recieved from people who have visited my website. I've taken alot of that feedback into consideration and added it in.

Over the course of coding my site, I encountered many kinds of bugs, especially when getting the svg's to animate, but I've solved a number of them.

Utilizing my colors and bubbles from the previous projects proved a slight challenge, but I got them all in there, mostly on the hover effects and favicon color change icon.

I'm excited to work with coding in the future, especially websites.
